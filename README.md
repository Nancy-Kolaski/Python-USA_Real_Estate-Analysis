# Python-USA_Real_Estate-Analysis
This is an analysis of real estate data for the U.S.A., looking at trends and correlations to determine factors that most influence the real estate market.  Location, seasonality, and house size had the biggest influence on this data set.  

## Key Questions
- What geographic areas generate the most real estate revenue?
- What states sell the lowest priced homes?
- Does size affect the market? Does bigger acre_lot or house_size impact selling?
- Do number of baths (i.e: 2+ baths) sell more than homes with only 1 bath? Do number of bedrooms influence houses sold?
- When have most houses been sold/bought? Is there a seasonal trend?
- Have the market trends changed over time? 

## Data & Tools
### Data
The dataset was one large csv file with information including
- location factors: address, zip, city, state
- previous sold dates
- house size
- acre lot size
- number of bed and bathrooms
- who the homes were brokered by
- status of home (for sale vs. not)
- price of home

### Tools
The following python libraries were used for this project
- pandas (for data analysis)
- seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- numpy and scipy (for mathematical equations)
- Quandl (for time-series data)
- Tableau (for further visualization and story presentation)
- Excel (for creating crosstab data, specifically for using random sample to import clustered data into tableau for visualization)

## Executing the code
The codes used for this analysis are all recorded in jupyter notebooks, located under 'scripts' folder.
